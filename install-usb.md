# Installation USB Drive
I'm creating my install drive on Windows, but with some Google'ing you can find a guide on how to create an install drive on macOS or Linux as well.  
You'll want to get your hands on a USB drive of at least 1GB.
Download the latest Arch Linux ISO from [the Arch Linux download page](https://www.archlinux.org/download/).  
I like to use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en_IE.html) to write the ISO to my USB drive.  
Select the ISO you downloaded, and make sure you selected the correct USB drive.  
For a modern machine, go with GPT as your partition scheme.
When clicking "START", you'll be asked whether you want to use ISO or DD mode. Go with ISO mode first, since this makes it easier to use the USB drive again after using it for the install.
If this doesn't work, use DD mode. You'll need to create a new partition table for your USB drive once you're done with the install.
